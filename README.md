## J.P. Morgan Chase Virtual Software Internship Experience

I enrolled in this program to gain some experience with what it would be like
to work as a software engineering intern at Chase. I completed 3 separate tasks that simulate soem of the work that interns do at Chase. Overall I think this was a great program and I feel more prepared to apply for internships for Summer 2023.
