## Written thought process that the video overview of the task asked for


I set the alert thresholds to 1.1 for the upper bound and 0.9 for the lower bound so that the alert 
would triger at +/- 10% of the historical average. I felt that the initial values provided (1.05 and 0.95)
were too low and the alert triggered several times in the first minute or so of streaming data before 
I adjusted the values. 

The main insight a trader would be able to draw from this dashboard is when the stocks being tracked deviate 
significantly from the historical average. A jump outside the higher or lower alert thresholds might let them
know that the stock is behaving differently than it has in the past and they can think about adjusting their
portfolios as necessary.
